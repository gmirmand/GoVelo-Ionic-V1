You will find below the readme of the application Go Vélo. This Readme this base on the starter Ionic, being already perfectly explained. This project includes various technical issues such as language management, API calls or access to phone storage.
There is no witchcraft! We let you consult the documentation of the different technologies used and let you consult / understand the code thanks to the comments.

## Pages

This app has a variety of ready-made pages. These pages help
you assemble common building blocks for your app so you can focus on your
unique features and branding.

The app loads with the `FirstRunPage` set to `TutorialPage` as the default. If
the user has already gone through this page once, it will be skipped the next
time they load the app.

If the tutorial is skipped but the user hasn't logged in yet, the Welcome page
will be displayed which is a "splash" prompting the user to log in or create an
account.

Once the user is authenticated, the app will load with the `MainPage` which is
set to be the `TabsPage` as the default.

The entry and main pages can be configured easily by updating the corresponding
variables in
[src/pages/pages.ts](https://github.com/ionic-team/starters/blob/master/ionic-angular/official/super/src/pages/pages.ts).

Please read the
[Pages](https://github.com/ionic-team/starters/tree/master/ionic-angular/official/super/src/pages)
readme, and the readme for each page in the source for more documentation on
each.

## Providers

This app contain some basic implementations of common providers.

### User

The `User` provider is used to authenticate users through its
`login(accountInfo)` and `signup(accountInfo)` methods, which perform `POST`
requests to an API endpoint that you will need to configure.

### Api

The `Api` provider is a simple CRUD frontend to an API. Simply put the root of
your API url in the Api class and call get/post/put/patch/delete 

## i18n

This Ionic app has internationalization (i18n) out of the box with
[ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core). This makes it easy to
change the text used in the app by modifying only one file. 

### Adding Languages

To add new languages, add new files to the `src/assets/i18n` directory,
following the pattern of LANGCODE.json where LANGCODE is the language/locale
code (ex: en/gb/de/es/etc.).

### Changing the Language

To change the language of the app, edit `src/app/app.component.ts` and modify
`translate.use('en')` to use the LANGCODE from `src/assets/i18n/`
